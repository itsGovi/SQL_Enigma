### **Day-to-Day Reporting (Basic-Intermediate)**

1. [X] Identify employees hired in the last 90 days before **2024-01-01** and compare their individual engagement scores to the overall department-level engagement score. Return the employees whose engagement score exceeds their department’s overall engagement score by more than 10%, along with their details such as `employee_id`, `full_name`, `department`, `position`, and `level`.
2. [X] Count the number of certifications by `industry_expertise` and `department`, then rank them by popularity within each `region`. Additionally, identify the top 3 most popular certifications across all regions, grouped by their `industry_expertise`.
3. [X] Identify the top 10 employees by total compensation within each of the 3 regions. For each of these employees, calculate their average billing rate and the percentage of total compensation they contribute within their region. Only include employees whose average billing rate exceeds the average billing rate of their respective region.
4. [X] Identify employees in the Americas region who have more than two active projects and an actual utilization > 85%. Additionally, calculate the percentage difference between each employee's actual utilization and their region's average actual utilization. Only include employees whose actual utilization is at least 10% higher than the regional average.
5. [X] For each department in the EMCA region, calculate the average project satisfaction of employees who have more than three active projects and actual utilization above 90%. Then, compare this department-level average with the overall company-wide average project satisfaction. Return only the departments where the average project satisfaction is below the company-wide average.
6. [X] Find employees whose `avg_team_size` exceeds the median team size of their department within their respective region. Additionally, ensure these employees have at least three active projects and an actual utilization above both their department and regional averages. Return their names, departments, regions, `avg_team_size`, and actual utilization.
7. [X] Identify **certifications** that have the **highest avg_innovation_score** **within each department** for  **entry-level employees** . Additionally, ensure that the **certification has been obtained by at least 5 employees** to avoid skewed results. Return the **certification name, department, and avg_innovation_score** sorted in descending order of innovation score.
8. [X] **Identify the top 3 departments** where the **average training hours of entry-level employees** is **above the overall median training hours** across all employees. Rank the departments by their average training hours in descending order. If multiple departments have the same average, break ties by the total number of employees in the department (higher count first). Return the department name, avg_training_hours, and employee_count.
9. [ ] Calculate the total revenue generated by employees in the Client Services department, grouped by region. Use the following revenue formula for each employee:

             revenue = billing_rate * (actual_utilization / 100) * active_projects

    Additionally, only consider regions where at least 5 Client Services employees have contributed to the revenue calculation (to avoid skewed results).
       Return the region and the total revenue, sorted in descending order of revenue.

2. [ ] Identify employees with flight_risk below 20 and span_of_control above 3.
3. [ ] Rank employees by their avg_actual_utilization within their job levels, grouped by department.
4. [ ] List employees whose knowledge_sharing_score is in the top 10% of their department.
5. [ ] Compute the percentage of employees in each specialization with more than one certification.
6. [ ] Identify departments with the smallest gaps between utilization_target and actual_utilization.
7. [ ] Display employees in the EMEA region sorted by retention_risk and delivery_quality.
8. [ ] Calculate avg_project_complexity by hire_year and compare trends across regions.
9. [ ] Find employees with direct_reports exceeding 5 and avg_project_satisfaction below 70.
1. [ ] List the top 5 primary_specializations by avg_performance_score and compare them across regions.
1. [ ] Identify employees with the highest flight_risk and their respective avg_training_hours.

* [ ] Identify employees in the **APAC region** whose **average project duration** exceeds both:

  1. The **department average** across all regions.
  2. The **regional median project duration** (specific to APAC).

  Additionally, classify each employee into **tenure groups** based on their  **years of experience** :

  * **0–2 years:** "Junior"
  * **3–5 years:** "Mid-Level"
  * **6+ years:** "Senior"

  Ensure that:

  * Use **window functions** to calculate department-level averages and regional medians.
  * Use **recursive CTEs** to generate tenure groups dynamically.
  * Exclude employees who have worked on **fewer than 3 projects** to filter out anomalies.

  **Return:** Employee ID, Name, Department, Region, Avg_Project_Duration, Department_Avg_Duration, APAC_Regional_Median, Tenure_Group

**Updated Question:**

Calculate the total revenue generated by employees in the Client Services department, grouped by region. Use the following revenue formula for each employee:

  **revenue = billing_rate * (actual_utilization / 100) * active_projects**

Additionally, only consider regions where at least 5 Client Services employees have contributed to the revenue calculation (to avoid skewed results).

Return the region and the total revenue, sorted in descending order of revenue.

---

**What This Requires You to Do:**

1. **Compute Revenue per Employee:**
   * Use the provided formula to calculate revenue on a per-employee basis.
2. **Group and Aggregate:**
   * Group the results by region (using a `GROUP BY` clause) and sum the individual revenues.
3. **Apply a Filter on Employee Count:**
   * Ensure that only regions with at least 5 employees in the Client Services department are included. You may need to use a HAVING clause for this.
4. **Sorting:**
   * Finally, sort the output in descending order by the total revenue.

This version keeps the challenge practical while still requiring you to combine computed fields, grouping, and filtering—similar in complexity to the certifications question.

Happy querying, and let me know if you need further hints!

Here's an updated version of the question that maintains a realistic day‑to‑day analysis level—comparable to the certifications question you mentioned:
