-- Question 21: Analyze the `base_salary` distribution across regions, and compare it with the average `total_comp` of managers and non-managers in each region.
"""
I've better aligned the question with data at hand (a bit harder too):
Analyze compensation differences among employees at the same level (mid, senior,
entry) across departments and positions. Incorporate team size (direct_reports)
and management responsibilities (is_manager) to identify how average total_comp
varies within each department and position. Highlight departments or roles where
the compensation gaps are significant.
